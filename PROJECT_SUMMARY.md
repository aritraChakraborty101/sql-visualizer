# Project Summary: SQL Query Execution Visualizer

## Overview
This is a complete full-stack application that visualizes SQL query execution step-by-step. Users can write SELECT queries and see how they are processed internally by the database engine.

## What Makes This Project Unique
The **novelty feature** is the step-by-step visualization that breaks down SQL query execution into logical stages:
1. FROM/JOIN - Shows the initial dataset or joined tables
2. WHERE - Displays filtered results
3. GROUP BY - Shows grouped data (when applicable)
4. SELECT - Shows column selection
5. ORDER BY - Shows final sorted results (when applicable)

Each step displays the intermediate state of the data, making SQL execution transparent and educational.

## Files Created

### Backend (`/backend`)

## Sample Data

### Departments Table
| id | name        | location  |
|----|-------------|-----------|
| 1  | Engineering | New York  |
| 2  | Sales       | London    |
| 3  | HR          | New York  |

### Employees Table
| id | name    | salary  | department_id |
|----|---------|---------|---------------|
| 1  | Alice   | 90000   | 1             |
| 2  | Bob     | 80000   | 1             |
| 3  | Charlie | 120000  | 2             |
| 4  | David   | 75000   | 3             |
| 5  | Eve     | 150000  | 2             |
| 6  | Frank   | 60000   | NULL          |

## How to Use

### Quick Start (Linux/Mac)
```bash
./start.sh
```

### Quick Start (Windows)
```batch
start.bat
```

### Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Example Queries to Try

1. **Basic SELECT**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees
   ```

2. **WHERE Filtering**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 80000
   ```

3. **JOIN Operation**
   ```sql
   SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.name as department 
   FROM employees e 
   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
   ```

4. **GROUP BY Aggregation**
   ```sql
   SELECT d.name, COUNT(*) as emp_count 
   FROM employees e 
   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id 
   GROUP BY d.name
   ```

5. **ORDER BY Sorting**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC
   ```

## Technology Decisions

1. **SQLite** - Lightweight, no server setup required, perfect for local development
2. **Flask** - Simple Python web framework, easy to understand
3. **React** - Modern UI library with component-based architecture
4. **sqlparse** - Robust SQL parsing library for Python
5. **Flask-CORS** - Enable cross-origin requests from React dev server

## Potential Enhancements

- Add support for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with visualization
- Query performance metrics (execution time, rows scanned)
- Query history
- Export results to CSV
- Multiple database support
- Query optimization suggestions
- Visual query builder
- Execution plan visualization
- Support for subqueries and CTEs

## Learning Objectives

This project teaches:
- SQL query execution order
- Full-stack development (React + Flask)
- REST API design
- Database design and relationships
- SQL parsing and analysis
- React state management
- Component-based UI design

## Status

✅ **Project Complete and Ready to Use**

All core features have been implemented and tested. The application is ready for local development and educational use.
