## 📊 Database Schema

### Main Database (`employees.db`)

#### `employees` Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER | Primary Key |
| name | TEXT | Employee name |
| salary | INTEGER | Annual salary |
| department_id | INTEGER | Foreign Key → departments.id |

**Sample Data:**
```
Alice   | $90,000  | Engineering
Bob     | $80,000  | Engineering
Charlie | $120,000 | Sales
David   | $75,000  | HR
Eve     | $150,000 | Sales
Frank   | $60,000  | (No department)
```

### `departments` Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER | Primary Key |
| name | TEXT | Department name |
| location | TEXT | Office location |

**Sample Data:**
```
Engineering | New York
Sales       | London
HR          | New York
```

### Case Database (`omnicorp_case.db`)

Used in Data Detective mode. Contains 4 interconnected tables with investigation data:

#### `employees` - Personnel records with security clearances
#### `security_logs` - Physical access logs (who, where, when)
#### `file_changelogs` - File system modification history
#### `memos` - Company communications revealing motives

See [DATA_DETECTIVE_GUIDE.md](DATA_DETECTIVE_GUIDE.md) for complete schema details.

## 💻 Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React 18 | Interactive UI components |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Modern, responsive design |
| **Backend** | Flask (Python) | REST API server |
| **Database** | SQLite | Lightweight, embedded database |
| **SQL Parsing** | sqlglot | AST-based query analysis |
| **Linting** | Custom Python | Code quality analysis |

## 🎨 Features in Detail

### Smart Query Validation

The platform doesn't just compare your query text—it executes both your query and the expected solution, then compares:
- **Column names** (order-independent)
- **Result data** (row-order-independent)
- **Row counts** for debugging

This means alternative correct solutions are accepted!

### SQL Linter Rules

Automatic analysis provides tips on:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| 🔵 **Best Practice** | Avoid `SELECT *`, use explicit column names |
| ⚡ **Performance** | Add `LIMIT` to large queries, avoid leading wildcards in `LIKE` |
| 📖 **Readability** | Use uppercase for SQL keywords, add table aliases |
| ⚠️ **Safety** | `UPDATE`/`DELETE` without `WHERE` affects all rows |
| ✅ **Correctness** | `NOT IN` with NULL values, understand `COUNT(*)` vs `COUNT(column)` |

### Complexity Scoring

Queries are scored based on:
- Basic SELECT: +1 point
- WHERE clause: +1 point
- Each JOIN: +2 points
- GROUP BY: +2 points
- HAVING: +2 points
- ORDER BY: +1 point
- Each aggregate function: +1 point

**Levels:**
- 🟢 **Beginner** (0-3 points)
- 🔵 **Intermediate** (4-6 points)
- 🟠 **Advanced** (7-10 points)
- 🔴 **Expert** (11+ points)

## 📝 Example Queries

### Beginner Level

**Simple Selection:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

**Specific Columns:**
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
```

**Filtering:**
```sql
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 80000;
```

**Sorting:**
```sql
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

### Intermediate Level

**Inner Join:**
```sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.name as department
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

**Left Join (include employees without departments):**
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name as department
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

**Filtering Joined Data:**
```sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.name as department
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.location = 'New York';
```

### Advanced Level

**Grouping and Aggregation:**
```sql
SELECT d.name as department, 
       COUNT(*) as employee_count,
       AVG(e.salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.name;
```

**Complex Analysis:**
```sql
SELECT d.name as department,
       d.location,
       COUNT(*) as emp_count,
       AVG(e.salary) as avg_salary,
       MAX(e.salary) as max_salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE e.salary > 70000
GROUP BY d.name, d.location
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**"Module not found" Error**
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Port 5000 Already in Use**
```python
# Edit backend/app.py, change the last line:
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Use different port
```

**Database Locked Error**
```bash
# Close any SQLite browser/tool accessing employees.db
# Or restart the Flask server
```

**"Only SELECT queries are allowed" Error**
- Make sure your query starts with `SELECT` (case-insensitive)
- Remove any leading comments or whitespace
- The app only accepts SELECT for security

### Frontend Issues

**Cannot Connect to Backend**
```bash
# Verify backend is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/schema

# Check if Flask shows this in terminal:
# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Port 3000 Already in Use**
```bash
# React will prompt you to use a different port
# Press 'Y' to accept the suggested alternative port
```

**npm Install Fails**
```bash
# Try clearing cache and reinstalling
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

**Styling Not Loading**
```bash
# Clear React cache and restart
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm start
```

### Common Issues

**Validation Always Fails in Lesson Mode**
- Check the console for specific error messages
- Make sure your query returns the same columns as the solution
- Row order doesn't matter, but column names and data must match

**Visualization Not Showing**
- Complex queries may fail to visualize but still execute
- Check the "Results" section for query output
- Try simpler queries first to test the feature

**Hints Not Appearing**
- Click the "💡 Show Hint" button in the lesson panel
- Not all lessons have hints available
- Hints are designed to guide, not give complete answers

## 🎓 Learning Tips

1. **Start with Lesson Mode** - Follow the curriculum for structured learning
2. **Read the Explanations** - Understand the "why" behind each concept
3. **Use Hints Wisely** - Try solving on your own first
4. **Check the Linter Tips** - Learn best practices as you go
5. **Experiment in Free Mode** - Try variations of queries to deepen understanding
6. **Watch the Visualization** - See how SQL processes your query step-by-step
7. **Compare Complexity Scores** - Track your progress as queries get more advanced
