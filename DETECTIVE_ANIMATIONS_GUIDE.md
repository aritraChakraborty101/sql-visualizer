# Data Detective Animation System

## Overview

The Data Detective mode now features a comprehensive animation system designed to create an immersive, narrative-driven retro mystery experience. Every animation reinforces the theme of being a vintage computer detective uncovering clues.

## Core Principle

**Animate the Process, Not Just the Result** - Users should feel like they're interacting with a vintage computer system, uncovering clues piece by piece.

## Animation Categories

### 1. The "Aha!" Moment - Clue Reveal Animations

The most important animation sequence, triggered when a correct query is submitted.

#### The Polaroid Develop Effect
When a clue is unlocked:
1. **Validation**: Terminal prints `> QUERY HASH MATCH... ACCESS GRANTED`
2. **Printing**: ASCII-art polaroid frame is drawn line-by-line
3. **Developing**: The clue text fades in like a developing photograph (2-3 seconds)
4. **Decryption**: Random characters cycle before resolving to readable text

**Implementation**:
```css
.polaroid-print - Print animation (0.5s)
.polaroid-develop - Develop effect (3s)
.clue-decrypt - Character decryption effect
.clue-reveal-animation - Full transmission sequence (1.5s)
```

**Features**:
- Full-screen overlay with dark background
- Retro border styling
- Skip capability with ENTER or SPACE key
- Sound effect on reveal

### 2. Success vs. Failure Feedback

Immediate, unambiguous visual and audio feedback for user actions.

#### For Correct Queries:
- **Border Flash**: Green pulsing border animation (3 flashes)
- **Access Granted**: Message slides in with bounce effect
- **Success Chime**: Ascending musical notes (C5-E5-G5)
- **Clue Notification**: Toast popup in top-right corner

**CSS Classes**:
```css
.success-flash - Border pulsing effect
.access-granted - Slide-in bounce animation
```

#### For Incorrect Queries:
- **Screen Glitch**: Brief digital corruption effect
- **Digital Static**: Scanline distortion overlay
- **Access Denied Shake**: Horizontal shake animation
- **Error Buzz**: Harsh low-frequency sound

**CSS Classes**:
```css

### 3. Narrative Transitions

Smooth, thematic transitions between investigation stages.

#### Screen Wipe/Refocus
When moving to a new stage:
1. Old narrative scrolls up and out
2. Scan line sweeps across screen
3. New message appears with typewriter effect
4. Header slides in from left

**CSS Classes**:
```css
.screen-wipe - Vertical reveal animation
.scan-line-wipe - Sweeping scan line effect

.message-header - Slide in from left
```

#### Incoming Message Effect
- FROM: header appears first
- Narrative types out character-by-character
- Blinking cursor at end of line

### 4. The Grand Finale - Case Closed

The biggest animated payoff when solving the mystery.

#### Case Closed Stamp
1. Massive stamp flies in from top
2. Rotates and scales during flight
3. "Thuds" down with impact bounce
4. Remains visible over clue board

**CSS Classes**:
```css
.case-closed-stamp - Fly-in animation (1s)
.stamp-impact - Impact bounce effect (0.5s)
```

**Sound**: Deep "thud" using sawtooth wave at 80Hz

```

---

### 6. Query Result Highlighting

Visual emphasis on important data in results.

#### Evidence Row Highlighting
When relevant data is found:
- Background color pulses 3 times
- Glowing effect on key rows
- Data "extraction" animation (future enhancement)

**CSS Classes**:
```css
.highlight-evidence-row - Pulsing background (3 times)
.evidence-glow - Continuous subtle glow
.extract-data-animation - Data flies to clue board
```

---

### 7. Loading & Processing States

Clear feedback during asynchronous operations.

#### Processing Indicators

- Loading bar with block characters: ▱▱▰▰▰▱▱
- Query execution spinner

**CSS Classes**:
```css
.processing-indicator::after - Animated dots
.loading-bar::after - Block character progress
```

---

### 8. Interactive Elements

Hover and interaction feedback.

#### Buttons
- Glow intensifies on hover
- Slight scale transformation
- Sound effect on click (optional)

**CSS Classes**:
```css
.detective-button:hover - Glow animation
```

#### Notifications

## Sound Effects System

All sounds generated using Web Audio API (no external files needed).

### Sound Types:

1. **Success Chime** (`playSound('success')`)
   - Ascending notes: C5 → E5 → G5
   - Duration: 0.3s
   - Volume: 0.3

2. **Error Buzz** (`playSound('error')`)
   - Sawtooth wave at 100Hz
   - Duration: 0.2s
   - Volume: 0.3

3. **Clue Unlock** (`playSound('clue')`)
   - Sine wave sweep: 440Hz → 880Hz

## User Controls

### Skip Animation Feature
Users can press **ENTER** or **SPACE** during any animation to skip to the end state.

- Hint appears in bottom-right corner during animations
- All animation timings respect skip state
- Provides control for power users

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const [skipAnimation, setSkipAnimation] = useState(false);

// In animation timing:
const animationDuration = skipAnimation ? 0 : 2000;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques:

1. **CSS Keyframes Over JavaScript**
   - More performant
   - Hardware accelerated
   - Smoother on low-end devices

2. **Transform-based Animations**
   - Use `transform` and `opacity` for best performance
   - Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`

3. **Will-change Hints**
   - Applied to frequently animated elements
   - Helps browser optimize rendering

4. **Animation Throttling**
   - Long animations can be skipped
   - Prevents animation queue buildup

---

## Implementation Guide

### Adding a New Animation:

1. **Define CSS in DetectiveAnimations.css**
```css
@keyframes myAnimation {
  0% { /* start state */ }
  100% { /* end state */ }
}

.my-animation-class {
  animation: myAnimation 1s ease-out forwards;
}
```

2. **Add State Management**
```javascript
const [showMyAnimation, setShowMyAnimation] = useState(false);
```

3. **Trigger in Component**
```javascript
setShowMyAnimation(true);
setTimeout(() => {
  setShowMyAnimation(false);
}, 1000);
```

4. **Apply Class Conditionally**
```jsx
<div className={showMyAnimation ? 'my-animation-class' : ''}>
  Content
</div>
```
